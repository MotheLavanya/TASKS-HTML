    <p id="paragraph">Technology is the practical application of scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems and improve human welfare. It aims to achieve either a commercial or industrial objective.Technology refers to tools [physical objects that people use to perform tasks], techniques [methods or procedures used to accomplish a particular task], and processes [a series of steps used to produce something] that are used to create, develop, and improve products or services. This can include things like computers, software, machines, and equipment, as well as methods for designing, building, and testing these things. Technology can be used in a variety of fields, such as healthcare [the maintenance of oneâ€™s well-being through medical services], education [the process of acquiring knowledge and skills], communication [the exchange of information], and entertainment [activities that are enjoyable and provide amusement], and it often has a significant impact on how people live and work.</p>
